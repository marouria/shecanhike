            Hi, I’m Marie. I created She Can Hike to bring women together
            through hiking. I wanted to meet other women who love being
            outdoors, to share moments of simplicity and connection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hiking helps me clear my mind and ease my anxiety. I’m someone who
            tends to overthink, worry about the future, and doubt myself
            constantly. But when I’m out on the trail, all those thoughts quiet
            down. I feel confident — like I’m exactly where I’m meant to be. The
            rhythm of my steps, the sound of the wind, the smell of the forest…
            it all brings me back to the present moment.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm not great at expressing myself with words, so hiking has become
            its own kind of therapy for me — my stress relief, my source of
            inspiration, a reminder that not everything is lost, and that nature
            itself is powerful despite how small our existence can feel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Traveling is another big passion of mine. Over the years, I’ve lived
            in six different countries. I’ve learned that the best way to
            understand a place is often to walk through it — to take the small
            paths, visit the remote villages, and meet people whose traditions
            have stayed alive for generations. Hiking lets you do exactly that.
          </p>
          <p>
            I do enjoy cities for their social side, but I can quickly feel
            overwhelmed by how fast everything moves. I feel like I’m always a
            few steps behind. When I’m hiking, all of that fades away. There’s
            no rush, no comparison, no noise. It’s one of the rare moments when
            I truly live in the present.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s what She Can Hike is all about — slowing down, connecting
            with nature, and reminding ourselves of how strong and capable we
            truly are. I do hope this community will help each other grow, lift
            one another up, and find comfort in knowing we’re not walking this
            journey alone.
          </p>
